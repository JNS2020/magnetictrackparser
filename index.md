# Magnetic Track Parser

*Magnetic Track Parser* is a Java library that can parse magnetic track data from a bank issued credit card, such as might be returned from a USB magnetic card stripe reader. 

All classes are immutable and thread-safe. The standard `toString()` function formats data in a readable form. Validity is enforced by JUnit tests. Java 6 or newer is required. Magnetic Track Parser depends on the [Credit Card Number](https://github.com/sualeh/credit_card_number) library.

The goal of this project is to use publicly and freely available documentation to create a reliable Java library to provide information about magnetic tracks and credit card numbers.

See the article on [Magnetic stripe card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card) on Wikipedia for information about the format of track data.

    Passes Luhn Check: true
```

### How to Parse Magnetic Track Data

To parse a magnetic track, use code like:
```java
final BankCardMagneticTrack track = 
    BankCardMagneticTrack.from("%B5350290149345177^FATEHI/SUALEH^16042010000000000000000000000000000567001000?;5350290149345177=16042010000056700100?");
System.out.println(track);
```
and you will get this output:
```
