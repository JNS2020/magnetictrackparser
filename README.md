# Magnetic Track Parser

*Magnetic Track Parser* is a Java library that can parse magnetic track data from a 
bank issued credit card, such as might be returned from a USB magnetic card stripe 
reader. 

> **The goal of this project is to use publicly and freely available documentation 
to create a reliable Java library to provide information about magnetic tracks and 
credit card numbers.**

All classes are immutable and thread-safe. Secure data follows standards in the 
[Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) Reference Guide](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html#PBEEx).
The standard `toString()` function 
formats data in a readable form. Validity is enforced by JUnit tests. 

Magnetic Track Parser depends on the [Credit Card Number](https://github.com/sualeh/credit_card_number) library.

Java 6 or newer is required. This library deliberately supports Java 6, to make it 
usable in Android apps.

Some resources consulted are:
* [Magnetic stripe card](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_stripe_card) on Wikipedia for information about the format of track data.

## Download

You can download the [jar on the Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22magnetictrackparser%22).

## Maven Build

To use *Magnetic Track Parser* in your Maven build, include the following 
dependency. No repositories references are needed, since the jars are in the Maven 
Central Repository.
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>us.fatehi</groupId>
    <artifactId>magnetictrackparser</artifactId>
    <version>2.01.02</version>
</dependency>
```

## Examples

### How to Get Bank Card Information

To get bank card information, use code like:
```java
AccountNumber pan = new AccountNumber("371449635398431");
BankCard card = new BankCard(pan);
System.out.println(card);
```
and you will get this output:
```

### How to Parse Magnetic Track Data

To parse a magnetic track, use code like:
```java
BankCardMagneticTrack track = 
  BankCardMagneticTrack.from("%B5350290149345177^FATEHI/SUALEH^16042010000000000000000000000000000567001000?;5350290149345177=16042010000056700100?");
System.out.println(track);
```
and you will get this output:
```

## Who Uses

- Dmitry Holodov's excellent Android app, [SwipeYours](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=to.noc.android.swipeyours) uses   _magnetictrackparser_. See details in [SetCardActivity.java](
https://github.com/dimalinux/SwipeYours/blob/master/src/main/java/to/noc/android/swipeyours/SetCardActivity.java#L34-L71). This Android app helps developers understand the new Android Host Card Emulation feature for payments, and is written with open source, in the same spirit as _magnetictrackparser_.
